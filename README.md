My default community health files shared across repositories.

Community health files forked and modified from [amazing-github-template](https://github.com/dec0dOS/amazing-github-template).

More information on community health files can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#about-default-community-health-files).
